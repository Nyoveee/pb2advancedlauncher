things left to do:
- move retrieveAccount code from accountTable to SidePanel. (or create an component inbetween)
- show account table based on json
- set up selection system of accounts (no account selected, 1 account selected)
- show password based on account selection
- changing login credentials unselect the account
- login saves the credentials
